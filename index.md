## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, Part 1
This was a very fun lab because I feel as if it was the perfect mix of challenging and easy. Learning how to convert measurements was somewhat challenging in the beginning however, once I was able to get the hang of it, it became easy and fun. 

Lab 7
I chose this lab as one of my favorites because of how challenging it was. I found this lab to be one of the most if not the most challenging lab we did all semester. It was a good relief when I finally finished it and managed to get it working correctly. This also helped me understand the use of vectors a lot more. 

Lab 10
Similarly to Lab 7, I enjoyed this lab due to its challenging aspects. This lab also really highlighted the use of vectors which helped get a much better understanding of them. The satisfaction and relief of being able to complete this lab was very memorable.
